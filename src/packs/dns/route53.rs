//! AWS Route53 DNS pack - protections for destructive Route53 operations.
//!
//! Covers destructive CLI operations:
//! - Hosted zone deletion
//! - DNS record set deletion via change-resource-record-sets
//! - Health check deletion
//! - Query logging config deletion
//! - Traffic policy deletion
//! - Reusable delegation set deletion
