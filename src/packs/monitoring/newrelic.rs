//! `New Relic` monitoring pack - protections for destructive `New Relic` operations.
//!
//! Covers destructive CLI/API operations:
//! - `newrelic ... delete` for entities, APM applications, workloads, and synthetics
//! - `curl -X DELETE` to `api.newrelic.com`
//! - GraphQL mutations containing delete operations (best-effort)
