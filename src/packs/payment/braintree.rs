//! `Braintree` payment pack - protections for destructive `Braintree` operations.
//!
//! Covers destructive API/SDK operations:
//! - `curl -X DELETE` to `braintreegateway.com` endpoints (customers, webhooks, etc.)
//! - SDK delete/cancel calls in scripts (e.g., `braintree.Customer.delete`, `gateway.customer.delete`)
//!
//! Note: Many `Braintree` workflows run via SDK calls embedded in scripts; this pack aims to
//! catch obvious deletion/cancellation primitives in command strings.
